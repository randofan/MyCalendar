# MyCalendar
MyCalendar is a Google chrome extension that launches on the [UW class schedule page](https://sdb.admin.uw.edu/sisStudents/uwnetid/schedule.aspx) and converts a user's registered courses into a calendar (.ics) file. With MyCalendar, students don't have to manually create a calendar event with the details of a course (time, recurrence, location, etc.) for all their courses every quarter.

## Features
1. Download your course schedule as an .ics file, which can be imported into any calendar app.
    - Works for any academic quarter
    - Calendar events are removed on holidays
2. Download a separate .ics file with all the section times for a class youâ€™re registered for. 
3. Change your preferences of the plugin, including which courses the .ics files include.
    - Note: if a course appears as "To be arranged" for its time and date on your schedule, its checkboxes will be disabled on the plugin.
4. Include a link to each course location on the UW map.

# Developer Guidelines

## Repository Layout
- src/popup: main execution thread
- src/scripts: content script

## Build
There's no need to build the Chrome extension because it's loaded as unpacked into Chrome.

## Test

#### Dependencies
- install [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/) and ensure ```npm``` is also installed
- install Chrome v112
- use MacOS/Linux OS

#### Run Tests
```
cd test
npm i
./setup.sh
npm test
```

#### Add New Tests
For each function you wish to unit test, add the `[relative path] [function name]` to `test.config`. Note you may only add unit tests for functions which don't reference `chrome` or `document` directly. Afterwards, open `unit.test.js` and import the function name using `require()`. Finally, follow Mocha's documentation with `describe()` and `it()` to add new unit tests using `assert()`. Note, we don't offer support for any other types of tests.

#### Building a Release
Complete the following before opening a pull request:
- Update the version number in `manifest.json`
    - First Number: Tracks major changes
    - Second Number: Tracks minor changes
    - Third Number: Tracks patches or bug fixes
- Conduct functional testing in the browser to ensure no errors return upon opening the extension.
