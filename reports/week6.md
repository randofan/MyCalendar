# Team Report/Agenda
## Old Goals
1. Implementing core of backend (Trinity & Gavin)
    - Flesh out each component. Get the popup functioning with mock scraped data
2. Figure out how to run the content scraper in the background and export that data to other components
3. Figure out what a viable testing architecture will be (David & Saket)
4. Figure out how to use shell scripts to automate building and CI/CD

## Issues
- What you did: 
  - Started implementing the backend
  - Successfully ran the frontend of the extension on Chrome locally
  - Solidify our testing architecture (Selenium & Mocha)
  - Setup our CI system through Git Actions
- What worked: Dividing and conquering worked really well this week. We all focused on separate parts of the project which allowed us to get a lot done.
- What you learned: We gained confidence in how we are are going to implement our browser through Chrome's API and how we will test our browser's integration/system. 
- Where you had trouble: David had some trouble setting up our CI system through Git action, but was able to figure it out. Otherwise, no other problems!
## New Goals
1. Finish backend (Trinity, Gavin, Saket)
2. Deploy functional extension in Chrome (locally)
3. Write basic tests for all components

## Saket
### Old Goals
1. continue to review javascript for the programing aspect of the project.
2. start on the sections.js module by creating the back end portion and the map for the html scraper.
3. start to build test modules to test functionality of the components.
### Issues
- What you did: very limited work this week, reviewed a bunch of javascript in order to start developing the main module that parses the time schedule
  to get the section information and other info to add to the calender. Tried to synthesize the html page of a time schedule to see what parts to try and   target and parse.
- What worked: being able to use documentation and look up how to actually use different functions, also being able to access the html page in it's 
  entirty using view page source to figure out what parts of the html code i need to target.
- What you learned: that there are many different ways to try and solve this problem to parse the information, but it is important to find a way to 
  not only figure out how to efficently create a program, but also figure out a way to create an implemntation that fits in with the overall structure
  of the layout we decided upon and utilize our resources as efficent as possible.
- Where you had trouble: figuring out the best implementation for parsing the document, and making sure that the code i am writing takes efficency and 
  code complexity into consideration
### New Goals
1. continue to review javascript for the programing aspect of the project.
