## Saket
### Old Goals
1. continue to review javascript for the programing aspect of the project.
2. start on the sections.js module by creating the back end portion and the map for the html scraper.
3. start to build test modules to test functionality of the components.
### Issues
- What you did: very limited work this week, reviewed a bunch of javascript in order to start developing the main module that parses the time schedule
  to get the section information and other info to add to the calender. Tried to synthesize the html page of a time schedule to see what parts to try and   target and parse.
- What worked: being able to use documentation and look up how to actually use different functions, also being able to access the html page in it's 
  entirty using view page source to figure out what parts of the html code i need to target.
- What you learned: that there are many different ways to try and solve this problem to parse the information, but it is important to find a way to 
  not only figure out how to efficently create a program, but also figure out a way to create an implemntation that fits in with the overall structure
  of the layout we decided upon and utilize our resources as efficent as possible.
- Where you had trouble: figuring out the best implementation for parsing the document, and making sure that the code i am writing takes efficency and 
  code complexity into consideration
