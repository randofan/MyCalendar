## Saket
### Old Goals
1.finish the sections.js module now adding the full html scrapper and connecting to main module.
2.continue to build test modules to test functionality of the components.
3.finalize documentation.
### Issues
- What you did: fix the errors that was causing section parsing to fail and fix the psrsing logic and making sure all the connections worked together.
- What worked: being able to code small parts of the logic at a time and testing it once at a time was helpful. Making sure that every module worked correctly was also helpful. Also clear communication with the TA helped
- What you learned: that there will be some times where unexpected issues occur. Just need to break the problem and communicate better to fix the problem.
- Where you had trouble: Nothing much. What needed to be done was pretty straight forward
### New Goals
