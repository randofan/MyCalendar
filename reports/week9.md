## Saket
### Old Goals
1. finish the sections.js module now adding the full html scrapper and connecting to main module.
2. continue to build test modules to test functionality of the components.
3. finalize documentation.
### Issues
- What you did: fix the errors that was causing section parsing to fail and fix the psrsing logic and making sure all the connections worked together.
- What worked: being able to code small parts of the logic at a time and testing it once at a time was helpful. Making sure that every module worked correctly was also helpful. Also clear communication with the TA helped
- What you learned: that there will be some times where unexpected issues occur. Just need to break the problem and communicate better to fix the problem.
- Where you had trouble: Nothing much. What needed to be done was pretty straight forward
### New Goals
1. Finish writing tests
2. finish user documentation
3. finish commenting code
4. get ready for final release.

## Trinity
### Old Goals
1. Continue to help implement section.js
2. Iron out any edge cases and what the popup should look like
### Issues
- What you did:
    - Made minor adjustments to architecture to enable testing of our DOM scraper functions that were in content.js. Wrote tests.
- What worked: Communicating async in Slack, working on separate branches 
- What you learned: Limitations of testing when we interact with external sources like the Chrome API for example. Limitations of interacting with the DOM in a Nodejs testing environment
- Where you had trouble: N/A
### New Goals
1. Work on edge case of if a course can not be made into an ICS file

## Gavin
### Old Goals
1. Work on building out support for including sections wherever I can.
### Issues
- What you did: I worked a lot on small adjustments to ics.js for supporting sections. I also added support for the map links.
- What worked: Working closely with my teammates to diagnose the issues that we ran into with sections and how to fix them.
- What you learned: I (re)learned that modifying passed-by-reference data is only okay if you're not going to use it again.
- Where you had trouble: I honestly didn't have much trouble. The bugs were pretty straightforward.
### New Goals
1. write more unit tests
2. help my teammates wherever I can preparing for final release.
