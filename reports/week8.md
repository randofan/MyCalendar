## Saket
### Old Goals
1. continue to review javascript for the programing aspect of the project.
2. continue working on the sections.js module by creating the back end portion and the map for the html scraper.
3. continue to build test modules to test functionality of the components.

### Issues
- What you did: I wrote a section time schedule parser which would access the registration and create the schedule objects and finished the parser logic.
- What worked: beingt able to test while developing. By being able to use the console on chrome and fixing bugs as they appear helped. Also that the time schedules are all formatted the same way.
- What you learned: that it is important to think about all the different ways to solve a problem. So I made a mistake and did not account for the login information needed for accessing the section pages, so I needed to figure out another way to parse the information without the login, which was within the time schedule. So finding other ways to solve a problem is important.
- Where you had trouble: Had trouble with the deadline of the assignments. Need more time to fully develop the desired funcitonality. So trying to find time and trying to extend the release of the sections update took time and was difficult to find time to do. 
### New Goals
1. finish the sections.js module now adding the full html scrapper and connecting to main module.
2. continue to build test modules to test functionality of the components.
3. finalize documentation.
