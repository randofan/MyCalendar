N/A
### Issues
- What you did: I wrote multiple issues in the GitHub repo to keep track of our future
progress in the project.
- What worked: I found that breaking the project down into smaller tasks made it much easier
to wrap my head around.
- What you learned: I learned about the concept of issues and milestones in Git, which I was
previously unfamiliar with.
- Where you had trouble: There wasn't really anywhere where I had trouble or got stuck, it
was very straightforward.
### New Goals
1. For this coming week, I want to focus on the architecture of the plugin, especially the
code behind parsing the calendar and creating the .ics file from it.
2. I think overall I want to work mostly on the code for converting between the different
data types that will be present in our plugin.
