# Team Report/Agenda
## Old Goals
1. Update project requirements. Include revised non-functional requirements.
2. Wireframe popup UI.
3. Design backend system architecture. Finalize a coding language and framework.
4. Determine what data we need to collect.
5. Get all mappings to time schedules. Each department has its own time schedule, so we need to find them all.
6. Figure out what software we will use to develop project.
## Issues
- What you did:
    - Finished fleshing out design and architecture
    - Finalized the popup wireframe
    - Open conversation on testing architecture
    - Updated our work timeline
- What worked:
    - Splitting up work and then reviewing as a team in class
- What you learned:
    - We're all shaking off some of the javascsript dust :)
- Where you had trouble:
    - Testing may be more complicated since we are deploying a browser extension. David is going to focus on this for the next week
## New Goals
1. Implementing core of backend (Trinity & Gavin)
    - Flesh out each component. Get the popup functioning with mock scraped data
2. Figure out how to run the content scraper in the background and export that data to other components
3. Figure out what a viable testing architecture will be (David & Saket)
